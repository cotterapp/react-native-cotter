# Cotter React Native SDK

Cotter's React Native SDK makes it quick and easy to build secure passwordless login using email or phone number in your Android app. We provide a full-suite authentication that includes SSO for email or phone number secured with the FIDO protocol.

Get started with our ðŸ“š [integration guides and example projects](https://docs.cotter.app/verify-email-and-phone-number/react-native-sdk).

### How to use the example app

The example app uses a mock backend that we create for testing. It gives API endpoints to register and login users. If you want to delete a user, go to https://0eexu.sse.codesandbox.io/? and enter the email you want to delete from the mock backend DB.
